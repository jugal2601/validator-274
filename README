Running Instructions: 

below the like "__main__:" line please enter both of the following lines
	*"validate((word))"
	*"generate(n)"

Notes and Assumptions:

	I am assuming that you are going to input the value n for the generate function, as I have not added a statement that uses a random n value.
	I am not sure if I was supposed to, but if i was supposed to this is the line I would have entered. 
	"n=random.randint(8,15)" 
	#keeping the max length to 15.
